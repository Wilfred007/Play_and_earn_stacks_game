```

## üîê Security Best Practices

### Answer Hash Generation

The tool uses SHA256 hashing with the format:
```
hash = SHA256(word + correctAnswer)
```

This ensures:
- **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same hash
- **Unpredictable**: Cannot reverse-engineer the answer from hash
- **Verifiable**: Can prove answer matches hash during reveal

### Admin Key Management

**For Testnet:**
- Use dedicated testnet keys
- Store keys securely (environment variables)
- Never commit private keys to version control

**For Mainnet:**
- Use hardware wallet or secure key management
- Consider multi-signature setup
- Implement key rotation procedures

### Round Creation Workflow

1. **Prepare Content**: Use educational, appropriate vocabulary
2. **Generate Round**: Use this tool to create properly hashed rounds
3. **Deploy Round**: Submit transaction to start round
4. **Monitor**: Track participation and engagement
5. **Reveal Answer**: After round ends, reveal with correct answer
6. **Verify**: Ensure prize distribution is correct

## üìö Educational Content Guidelines

### Word Selection Criteria

- **Appropriate Level**: Challenging but learnable
- **Educational Value**: Builds vocabulary meaningfully
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Inclusive and respectful
- **Variety**: Mix of word types, origins, and difficulty

### Definition Quality
