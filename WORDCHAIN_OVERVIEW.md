# 🧠 WordChain: Complete Project Overview

## 📋 Project Summary

**WordChain** is a revolutionary learn-to-earn vocabulary game built on the Stacks blockchain. Players learn new words while earning STX rewards through fair, transparent gameplay powered by smart contracts.

### 🎯 Core Concept
- **Educational Gaming**: Vocabulary challenges with multiple-choice questions
- **Blockchain Rewards**: STX prize pools distributed to correct answers
- **Fair Play**: Commit-reveal cryptographic scheme prevents manipulation
- **Community Driven**: Future DAO governance for content and features

## 🎮 Game Flow

### 1. Round Creation (Admin)
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Admin selects word] --> B[Creates 4 definitions]
    B --> C[Generates answer hash]
    C --> D[Deploys round to blockchain]
    D --> E[Round becomes active]
```

### 2. Player Participation
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Player sees active round] --> B[Pays 1 STX entry fee]
    B --> C[Selects answer option]
    C --> D[Submits guess to blockchain]
    D --> E[Waits for round completion]
```

### 3. Round Completion
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Round timer expires] --> B[Admin reveals answer]
    B --> C[Smart contract validates hash]
    C --> D[Identifies correct players]
    D --> E[Distributes STX prizes]
    E --> F[Updates player statistics]
```

## 💰 Tokenomics

| Component | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Entry Fee** | 1 STX | Cost to join each round |
| **Treasury Fee** | 5% | Platform sustainability |
| **Prize Pool** | 95% | Distributed to winners |
| **Round Duration** | ~24 hours | Time to submit guesses |

### Example Economics
**Round with 10 Players:**
- Total Entry Fees: 10 STX
- Treasury Fee: 0.5 STX (5%)
- Prize Pool: 9.5 STX (95%)
- If 3 players correct: 3.17 STX each

## 🔐 Security & Fairness

### Commit-Reveal Scheme
```
1. Admin creates hash: SHA256(word + correct_answer)
2. Hash stored on-chain before players guess
3. Players submit guesses during round
4. Admin reveals answer + validates against hash
5. Smart contract distributes prizes automatically
```

### Security Features
- ✅ **Cryptographic Fairness**: Impossible to manipulate answers
- ✅ **Access Control**: Only authorized admin can manage rounds
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter checking
- ✅ **Automatic Distribution**: No manual intervention for prizes
- ✅ **Transparent Operations**: All actions recorded on blockchain
